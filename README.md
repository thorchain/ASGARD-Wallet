# Experimental #

This codebase contains experimental prototyping software for research and development of blockchain keystore/wallet services only. 

*Not for public use!*

## Security ##

Many known security vulnerabilities are included in the prototyping codebase which are not acceptable for production or deployment for live use with crypto-currencies. It should be used only for internal experimentation and development, as well as research.

## Dependencies: ##

**Meteor**

Ultra fast prototyping framework.

`meteor-desktop `

Plugin is used to take multi-platform build capabilities of Meteor and extend it to desktop/electron platform.

**Keyring-controller:**

Commonly used and testing in the wild keyring/wallet management library. Uses blockchain/key agnostic keyring protocol.

**Cosmos libs:**

Several different cosmos API libs are beign tested for features etc.

During this phase of early development, this codebase repository will be used to share information and demonstrate the theory behind a multi-key wallet capable of supporting multiple platforms, as well as interacting with the Thorchain network.
